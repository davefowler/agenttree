# Host configurations
# Hosts are execution environments that handle stages in the workflow.
# Each host can specify container settings, AI tool, model, and skills.
hosts:
  # Controller: Human-driven, runs on host machine (no container)
  # Runs the sync server which spawns agents and runs hooks
  controller:
    description: "Human-driven controller"
    process: "agenttree serve"  # Runs in tmux, handles syncs

  # Default AI agent: runs in container
